It runs in a way similar to an open-end fund runs. Pool participants can deposit into and withdraw from the pool every accounting day.  \r\n\r\n - **Why to participate?**\r\n\r\nBy deposit fund into the Nu Lagoon, you are providing liquidity to support Nubits pegging at $1, which is crucial for Nu. And your fund will be expected to have 7.2% monthly return or 130% annual return. The actual return could be less or more than expected because of the volatility of BTC price against USD and other factors.\r\n\r\n - **How to participate?**\r\n\r\nExtremely easy. Send BTC or NBT to deposit address listed above. Send 0.0001 BTC or 0.01 NBT to the same address to withdraw funds. Don't send fund from address which is not controlled by you, for example, your exchange account.\r\n\r\n - **What else I should know?**\r\n\r\nPlease carefully read the terms of the Nu Lagoon Pool A. Participating the pool means you understand and agree with the terms of the pool. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFund Deposit & Withdraw Guide for the Nu Lagoon\r\n-----------------------------------------------\r\n\r\nTo deposit fund or submit a withdraw order to the Nu Lagoon, you need to use the coin control feature.
