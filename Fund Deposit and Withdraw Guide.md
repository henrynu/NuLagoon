To send transactions to Nu Lagoon Tube / Pools, you need to specify the address which you would like to send from. This is a guide for anyone not familiar with it.

NuLagoon recommends [Electrum ](https://electrum.org/#download) and [Nu client](https://www.nubits.com/download) to be the Bitcoin and NuBits wallet.

 - **Trouble-shooting: Strange address recovery**

If a strange address is used as the first input address in your deposit transaction somehow, don't worry. You can recover that strange address back to your control by dump and import its private key in the debug window console.
